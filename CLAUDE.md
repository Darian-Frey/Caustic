# CLAUDE.md

## Project

Caustic is a C++20 desktop studio for generative geometric art — chord patterns ("string art") and roulette curves ("spirograph"), with live parameter editing via rlImGui and vector SVG export. Targets a freemium release on itch.io alongside an open-source GitHub repo.

## Current state

**Phases 0–4 complete (2026-05-10); Phase 5 next.** All four v1 generators implemented; `GeometryBuffer`, dirty-flag rendering, full style system (colormaps, indexers, stroke modulation, cyclic remap for closed curves), and the rlImGui UI are all live. App now drives everything from `AppState`: generator combo, per-generator parameter sliders with scroll-wheel ±step / Shift×10 / Ctrl×0.1, coarse drag-time preview tier, full style panel, and camera (middle-click pan, cursor-relative scroll-zoom, F/0 reset). Build green, 42 doctest cases passing.

Pinned dependency matrix (BUILD.md is the source of truth): raylib 6.0, rlImGui `Raylib_6_0`, Dear ImGui v1.92.7, nlohmann/json v3.11.3, doctest v2.4.11. rlImGui's `Raylib_*` tags name the matching raylib release — bump in lockstep.

**Phase 4 deviation worth remembering:** R/r and a/b sliders are integer-only. The architecture's "drag through irrational a/b to watch Lissajous precess" demo is unavailable until someone adds a sample-over-many-revolutions mode + toggle. d, A, B, φ stay continuous (they don't affect closure).

## Active task

**Phase 5 — Preset system.** See ROADMAP.md for deliverables. JSON serialise/deserialise of full app state (generator + params + style + camera) using `nlohmann/json`; Save / Load buttons in File menu; preset browser panel; XDG user directory at `~/.config/caustic/presets/`; at least 5 bundled presets in `presets/`. Schema is authoritative in [SPEC.md §3](SPEC.md). Acceptance: save a preset, restart, load it — visual output identical; preset JSON is human-readable.

## Invariants

These rules MUST hold across all phases. Violating any is a bug.

1. **`core/` has zero raylib dependency.** It produces geometric primitives only. The SVG renderer, CLI tool, and tests must build without ever pulling raylib in. If raylib leaks into `core/`, the layering is broken.
2. **Math precision is `double` throughout `core/`.** Cast to `float` only at the GPU boundary inside `render/raylib_renderer.cpp`. Trig accumulates over many chords; the precision matters.
3. **Coordinate convention: math-up (+y up, origin centred) in `core/`.** Y-flip happens inside renderers only.
4. **On-demand rendering, not per-frame.** Geometry only regenerates when the dirty flag is set. Idle CPU/GPU when no parameter is moving. See ARCHITECTURE.md §5.4 for the full model.
5. **Determinism.** Same preset → byte-identical SVG. No time-dependent state without explicit seeding.
6. **Headless capability.** Every feature must work from `cli/` without a window.

## Build & test commands

```bash
# Debug build with tests
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure

# Release build
cmake -B build-release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-release -j

# Run the app
./build/app/caustic

# Run the CLI
./build/cli/caustic-cli --help
```

## Conventions

- **C++ style:** roughly Google C++ Style with 4-space indent. `snake_case` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for types and concepts, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- **Header layout:** one class per header where reasonable. `.hpp` for headers, `.cpp` for sources. Public headers in `core/include/caustic/...` use angle brackets (`#include <caustic/vec2.hpp>`); internal-only headers use quotes.
- **Include order:** standard library → third-party → caustic, alphabetised within each group.
- **Commit messages:** imperative mood, scope prefix where useful — e.g. `core: add Vec2 type`, `app: bind k-slider to dirty flag`, `docs: refresh CLAUDE.md`. One topic per commit. Doc-only updates committed separately from code.
- **Tests:** doctest, one test file per source file in `tests/`, named `test_<unit>.cpp`.

## Pitfalls

Captured from architecture review — do not relearn these the hard way.

- **rlImGui version drift.** rlImGui is community-maintained and pinned to specific raylib versions. Always check rlImGui's README for the supported raylib version before bumping either dependency.
- **`SetTargetFPS(60)` does NOT skip the geometry pass.** It limits the render loop, but the dirty-flag check is what gates regeneration. Don't conflate them.
- **raylib's `DrawLine` is unfiltered.** For dense chord patterns, anti-aliasing requires either offscreen high-res `RenderTexture` downsampling or `GL_LINE_SMOOTH` (driver-dependent). Address in Phase 1 if aliasing is visible.
- **Hypotrochoid drift.** Sample by closed-form `t` from the analytic period; never integrate over many revolutions — drift accumulates and the curve will visibly fail to close.
- **`ImGui::IsItemActive()` vs `IsItemHovered()`.** Active = currently being dragged. Hovered = mouse over but not necessarily clicked. The drag-time coarse preview tier uses `IsItemActive()`.
- **Scroll-wheel-on-canvas vs scroll-wheel-on-slider.** Both are scroll inputs. Disambiguate by checking which widget is hovered before consuming the scroll delta.

## Out of scope

Do NOT add the following without explicit confirmation:

- 3D / spherical / hyperbolic variants
- Audio reactivity
- Physical string simulation (tension, gravity)
- G-code / plotter direct output (post-process the SVG instead)
- Network features
- Multi-window / docking layouts (single fixed three-pane layout for v1)
- Custom shader effects (stay CPU-side for v1)
- New generators in v1 beyond: modular chord, hypotrochoid, epitrochoid, Lissajous
- L-systems, tilings (Penrose, Truchet) — different paradigm; would shift Caustic's identity beyond envelope/roulette curves

Planned for v1.1 (do not lobby back into v1):

- Rose curve, Maurer rose, superformula, phyllotaxis — Phase 9 (parametric curve expansion)
- Strange attractors (Clifford, de Jong, Tinkerbell) — Phase 10 (iterative-orbit infrastructure, seed-based determinism)
